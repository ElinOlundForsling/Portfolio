          Hello, I'm an overbearing cat-mom and a very loving but often
          neglectful plant-mom. I write excellent code and make excellent
          cocktails. In a team, I'm the moodmaker, and I aspire to be the person
          that automatically gets the onboarding duty, as I love meeting new
          people, and to talk about code and the ins and outs and arounds of it.
        </p>

          and from that I'm used to fast-paced working environments, SCRUM,
          AGILE workflows and an unexpected appriciation for McDonalds.
